From github release v

Thank you for downloading my Safezone Script. This was originally from somewhere else but I edited it to be 10x better with a couple of more features so you dont have to switch your notify type to a second one and have multiple notification scripts in your server. Below will tell you how to allow someone to bypass the safezone restrictions. Have fun!

safezones.bypass - ace perms to bypass the safezone restrictions with /sbypass example: add_ace group.unrestricted safezones.bypass allow // would be put in server.cfg

Learn about ace perms here: https://docs.badger.store/fivem-general-help/ace-permissions
